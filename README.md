# BlogExpress

BlogExpress is a simple web application for creating and publishing blog posts. It is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Getting started

To run the application locally, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. Once you have those dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/eliaskohut/BlogExpress.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd BlogExpress`
3. Install the required packages: `npm install`
4. Start the application: `npm start`
5. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to see the application running

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can create a new user account and start creating blog posts. You can also view, edit, and delete existing posts. By default, the application stores posts in a MongoDB database. You can change the database connection settings in the `database.js` file.
