BlogExpress
BlogExpress is a simple web application for creating and publishing blog posts. It is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

Getting started
To run the application locally, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. Once you have those dependencies, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/eliaskohut/BlogExpress.git
Navigate into the project directory: cd BlogExpress
Install the required packages: npm install
Start the application: npm start
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to see the application running
Usage
Once the application is running, you can create a new user account and start creating blog posts. You can also view, edit, and delete existing posts. By default, the application stores posts in a MongoDB database. You can change the database connection settings in the config/database.js file.
